        Hello, welcome to my personal website! My name is Leonardo Bogazzi.
        I have many interests such as computers, gaming, reading, and drawing.
        My family and I travel a lot and as a result we have moved quite a lot. 
        I was raised in Panama before i came back to the U.S.
